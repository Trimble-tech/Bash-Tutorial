**Purpose**
This project is a series of scripts each oriented around teaching usage of Bash.
Similar shells to Bash like ZSH may work but are not tested at this time.

This was originally written for presentation at:
> LILUG, Long Island Linux User's Group
> April 2025 Meeting

Feel free to learn more about the organization here: https://lilug.org/about.html

However, this project is open to all and I look forward to many learning with this toolkit.

**Usage**
The following methods are good ways to make use of this project:
1. Run the tutorial.sh script and let it guide you through lessons (recommended).
2. Find particular lessons or content and just do those. This can be done either by selecting the individual lesson in tutorial.sh or manually running your script of choice.
3. Pick apart code and try using it as a starting point for your own projects. All of this code is open source so you are free to make what you wish. However, if derivative works or changes are published they need to be shared freely under GNU GPL v3. Refer to license.txt for more info.

**File & Folder Locations**
All scripts for the turtorial are meant to run in their original folder.
The "example tools" folder is able to run elsewhere as there are no dependencies on tutorial files.

Here is what each folder serves:
- *examples*: 
> Scripts that serve a helpful purpose but aren't related to the tutorial. 
> Work with these to try a concept or learn how to build something.

- *lessons*:
> Scripts that are meant to teach something.
> These have lots of dialog and are meant to be run by tutorial.sh.
> Feel free to run these on their own or study the dialogs and loops.

- *sandbox*: 
> This folder has example files and folders for users to play with.
> Combine files, add/delete folders, play around in here.

- *scripts*: tools the tutorial.sh script runs to talk with the user.

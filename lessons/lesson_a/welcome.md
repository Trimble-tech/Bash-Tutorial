# Introduction to Bash

## LILUG April 2025

**Hello and welcome to the Bash tutorial**
In this tutorial, we will cover the following:
1. File oriented logic
2. Basic shell commands
3. Writing a script

Linux, Unix, or MacOS with Bash will be needed for this tutorial.

*In the beginning*, there was no display with fancy menus, no colors, and no wizards.
There were only text prompts.

To navigate these prompts, a terminal was necessary to obtain and use text input or output.
Now, there are many systems, like Unix or Linux, which can be used with graphics.
But, the power of the terminal can make the computer faster and easier to use.
The primary tool to harness the programs and files of these systems is ***Bash***.

**To proceed, refer to these instructions depending on the text editor you chose:**

**VIM**: *Esc*, then type :wq
**Nano**: Press *Ctrl* and *X* at the same time
**More**: Press an arrow key until at the bottom of the document
**Less**: Press an arrow key to read the document, then press *Q*
